            The Motto of NSS "Not Me But You", reflects the essence of
            democratic living and upholds the need for self-less service. NSS
            helps the students development &amp; appreciation to other person's
            point of view and also show consideration towards other living
            beings. The philosophy of the NSS is a good doctrine in this motto,
            which underlines on the belief that the welfare of an individual is
            ultimately dependent on the welfare of the society as a whole and
            therefore, the NSS volunteers shall strive for the well-being of the
            society.
          </p>
          <h3 className="font-bold mt-3 mb-1">NSS Logo:</h3>
          <p style={{ "text-align": "justify" }}>
            The logo for the NSS has been based on the giant Rath Wheel of the
            world famous Konark Sun Temple (The Black Pagoda) situated in
            Orissa, India. The Red &amp; Blue colors contained in the logo
            motivate the NSS Volunteers to be active &amp; energetic for the
            nation-building social activities. The wheel portrays the cycle of
            creation, preservation and release and signifies the movement in
            life across time and space, The wheel thus stands for continuity as
            well as change and implies the continuous striving of NSS for social
            change.
          </p>
          <h3 className="font-bold  mt-3 mb-1">NSS Badge:</h3>
          <p style={{ "text-align": "justify" }}>
            The NSS logo is embossed on the badge of NSS. The eight bars in the
            wheel of NSS logo represent the 24 hours of a day. The red colour
            indicates that the volunteer is full of young blood that is lively,
            active, energetic and full of high spirit. The navy blue colour
            indicates the cosmos of which the NSS is tiny part, ready to
            contribute its share for the welfare of the mankind.
